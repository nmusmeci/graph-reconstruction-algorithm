# Network reconstruction algorithm
Algorithm that reconstructs missing connections of a network starting from a limited amount of information.

I invented this technique as part of my Master degree's thesis in Statistical Physics. We demonstrated its predictive power in a number of real-world applications, such as interbank lending and world trade networks, in peer-reviewed scientific papers [1,2].

The algorithm takes as input the following variables:

* a non-topological quantity for each node, called "fitness", which is somehow correlated with the number of connections of the node (e.g. GDP of a country, which correlates with the country's number of trading connections)
* number of connections of at least one node in the network ("seed")

The missing connections are reconstructed by running a "fitness model" [3] whose main parameter "z" is calculated by Maximum Likelihood Estimation using the information provided by the seed(s). Since the algorithm assumes that a "fitness model" is a good approximation for the network structure, the more this assumption is reasonable the more reliable the reconstructed network is.
